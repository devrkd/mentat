# Skill: architect.task-intake

## Purpose
Collect source-of-truth requirements from the configured `task` category source before planning or review. By default, creates a main task and one sub-task per in-scope functional requirement. Skipped entirely when `skip_task_tracking: true` is passed.

## Inputs
- Task ID or URL (optional)
- Optional workspace/project/team identifier
- List of in-scope functional requirements (from doc-intake output)
- `skip_task_tracking` flag (default: `false`)

## Behaviour by flag

### When `skip_task_tracking: true`
Skip this skill entirely. Do not create or fetch any tasks or sub-tasks. Do not ask the user for a task ID. Return an empty task index. The ADR and Developer handoff will reference FRs by label only.

### When `skip_task_tracking: false` (default)
Execute all steps below.

## Steps

### Main task
1. If Task ID/URL is not provided and `skip_task_tracking` is false, check the source doc for any referenced task ID first before asking the user.
2. If a task ID is found, fetch it via the configured `task` MCP.
   If no task ID is available, create a new task in the default team folder:
   - Title: `[AI] <concise summary from doc title>`
   - Description body: source doc URL, problem framing, scoped summary
3. Extract objective, scope, constraints, edge cases, and acceptance hints.
3a. Extract any `github.com` or `gitlab.com` repository URLs from the task description,
    comments, or custom fields. Record these as `repo_urls_in_task` in the output for
    consumption by `architect.github-repo-intel`.
4. Flag unclear or conflicting requirements and request clarification from the user if needed.
5. Record the main task ID and URL for use in sub-task creation, ADR, and Developer handoff.

### Sub-task creation (one per in-scope FR)
6. For each in-scope functional requirement identified by doc-intake:
   a. Create a sub-task under the main task via the `task` MCP.
   b. Sub-task title format: `[AI] <main task title> — <FR label>: <short description>`
      - Example: `[AI] Small Balances — FR4: Order validation bypass for small balance sells`
   c. Sub-task description:
      - Body: verbatim FR text from the source doc, plus any user-provided scope notes
   d. Record the sub-task ID and URL.
7. After all sub-tasks are created, produce a sub-task index (FR label → sub-task ID/URL) for use in ADR authoring and the Developer handoff.

Note: If TASK_PROVIDER_TOKEN is not present and `skip_task_tracking` is false, the Architect must warn the user that task creation will be skipped and proceed as if `skip_task_tracking: true`.

## Output
- `skip_task_tracking: true` → empty output; no task index produced
- `skip_task_tracking: false` (default) →
  - Main task ID and URL
  - Sub-task index: list of `{ fr, subtask_id, subtask_url, title }` entries — one per in-scope FR
  - Constraints and edge cases
  - Requirement checklist for verification
  - Mismatch/ambiguity notes
  - `repo_urls_in_task`: list of `github.com`/`gitlab.com` repository URLs found in the task description, comments, or custom fields (may be empty)
