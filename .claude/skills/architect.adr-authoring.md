# Skill: architect.adr-authoring

## Purpose
Create architecture decision records (ADRs) in the configured documentation source using the canonical ADR template. This skill is **mandatory for every task** and must be executed before the Developer handoff is produced.

## Required Template
- ADR template URL: 
- Template note ID: 

## Rules
1. Always fetch and follow the ADR template structure before writing a new ADR.
2. Keep section ordering aligned with the template unless a section is explicitly not applicable.
3. Cover both frontend and backend impacts when the change spans both domains.
4. Create the ADR under the same parent folder as the source requirement note (for example PARP parent).
5. **Mermaid diagram preservation (partial updates).** When updating only one or more sections of an existing ADR (i.e. not a full rewrite), you MUST:
   a. Fetch the full current document content via the documentation MCP **before** composing the update payload.
   b. Copy every section that is NOT being changed **verbatim** from the fetched content — character for character, including all whitespace and newlines.
   c. Never re-serialise, reformat, or re-render any Mermaid block. The triple-backtick fences and the `flowchart TD` line must appear exactly as returned by the documentation MCP. **Do not move `flowchart TD` outside its code fence.** The correct structure is:
      ````
      ```
      flowchart TD
          ...
      ```
      ````
      Any output that places `flowchart TD` on a line that is not directly inside a fenced block is a bug.
   d. If you are unsure whether a section has changed, treat it as unchanged and copy it verbatim.

## Inputs
- Requirement note ID/URL (documentation page)
- Task ID/URL
- Architect design and implementation plan (produced in planning phase)
- **Repo intel record** (produced by `architect.github-repo-intel`) — required; contains confirmed language, framework, build tool, test framework, directory layout per repo. ADR must not be drafted without this.
- Target parent note ID (or source note parent)
- Related repository links
- Constraints, risks, and acceptance criteria

## Required ADR Sections
Every ADR must contain all of the following sections (in addition to any sections in the template):

### 1. API Specification Changes
For every API endpoint that is added, modified, or removed:
- **Endpoint** — HTTP method + path (e.g. `GET /api/v1/fee-estimate`)
- **Change type** — new / modified / removed
- **Request changes** — new or modified query params, path params, or request body fields (name, type, required/optional, description)
- **Response changes** — new or modified response fields (name, type, description, example value)
- **Breaking change?** — yes/no and migration notes if yes

If no API changes are needed, state it explicitly: "No API changes required."

### 2. Change Flow Diagrams
When changes affect **backend only**: one `flowchart TD` diagram.
When changes affect **frontend only**: one `flowchart TD` diagram.
When changes affect **both backend and frontend**: two separate diagrams — one for backend flow, one for frontend flow — each in its own titled subsection.

Each diagram must show **only the new (to-be) flow** — the proposed changes after implementation. Do not include an AS-IS subgraph or any representation of the existing flow. The diagram is for reviewers to understand what is being built, not a before/after comparison.

Each diagram must include:
- Clear component labels (e.g. `User`, `Frontend`, `API Gateway`, `rfq-platform`, `Fee Resolver`, `Exchange Engine`, `Config Service`)
- Decision branches where applicable (e.g. `order_value < threshold?`, `user_segment == retail?`)
- API call labels on edges where a service boundary is crossed (e.g. `POST /orders`, `GET /fee-estimate`)

Example skeleton (backend):
```
flowchart TD
    A[Order request] --> B[rfq-platform: validation passes]
    B --> C{user_segment == retail?}
    C -- No --> D[Fee Resolver: fee_tier=standard]
    C -- Yes --> E{order_value < small_balance_threshold?}
    E -- Yes --> F[Fee Resolver: fee_tier=small_balance_trade 2%]
    E -- No --> D
    D --> G[Exchange Engine: order accepted]
    F --> G
```

Example skeleton (frontend):
```
flowchart TD
    A[User enters amount] --> B[GET /api/v1/fee-estimate]
    B --> C[rfq-platform API: returns fee_tier + fee_amount_eur]
    C --> D[OrderPreview: shows EUR fee + info tooltip]
    D --> E[User confirms]
    E --> F[POST /api/v1/orders]
```

### 3. High-Level Code Changes
For each affected repo, list the expected code changes at module/file level. All file paths must use conventions confirmed by the repo intel record (not guessed). Do not write implementation code here — full snippets go in section 5:

Format per repo:
```
Repo: <repo-slug>  [language: <confirmed language>  framework: <confirmed framework>]
  New files:
    - <path/to/file.ext> — <one-line description>
  Modified files:
    - <path/to/file.ext> — <what changes>
  Deleted files:
    - <path/to/file.ext> — <reason>
  Config / env changes:
    - <KEY_NAME> — <description, type, default value>
```

### 4. Metrics and Observability
List every metric the application must expose after this change so the team can track impact and detect regressions:

| Metric name | Type | Labels / dimensions | Description | Alert threshold (if applicable) |
|-------------|------|---------------------|-------------|----------------------------------|
| `orders.submitted` | Counter | `fee_tier`, `user_segment`, `market` | Count of submitted orders by tier | — |
| `orders.fee_collected_eur` | Histogram | `fee_tier` | Fee collected per order in EUR | — |
| `small_balance.validation_bypass_count` | Counter | `user_segment` | Orders that bypassed min_tradeable check | Spike > baseline + 3σ |

Also specify:
- **Dashboard** — which existing dashboard should be updated (or a new one created)
- **Log events** — structured log fields to emit at order execution (e.g. `fee_tier`, `fee_amount_eur`, `order_value`)
- **Runbook pointer** — link or title of the runbook for alerts related to this change (can be "TBD — create before launch")

### 5. Code Snippets
For each file listed in High-Level Code Changes that contains non-trivial logic, include a short illustrative code snippet showing the proposed change. These are **not full implementations** — they show interfaces, key function signatures, and the critical logic block so reviewers can evaluate the approach.

Rules:
- **Use the confirmed language and framework from the repo intel record.** If the repo intel says Kotlin + Spring Boot, all backend snippets must be Kotlin. If it says TypeScript + React, all frontend snippets must be TypeScript/TSX. Never guess or use a different language.
- Each snippet must be in a fenced code block with the correct language tag (e.g. ` ```kotlin `, ` ```typescript `).
- Label each snippet with the file path it belongs to.
- Focus on the changed logic: new class/function signatures, modified conditionals, new component props — not boilerplate.
- Mark any uncertain path or name with `// [verify with team]`.

Example format:
```
#### `internal/fees/FeeTierResolver.kt`
```kotlin
// [verify path with team]
@Component
class FeeTierResolver(
    @Value("\${trading.small_balance_threshold}") private val threshold: BigDecimal,
    @Value("\${trading.small_balance_fee_rate}") private val smallBalanceRate: BigDecimal,
) {
    fun resolve(orderValue: BigDecimal, userSegment: UserSegment): FeeTier {
        if (userSegment != UserSegment.RETAIL) return FeeTier.standard()
        return if (orderValue < threshold) {
            FeeTier(type = "small_balance_trade", rate = smallBalanceRate)
        } else {
            FeeTier.standard()
        }
    }
}
```

#### `src/components/OrderPreview/OrderPreview.tsx`
```typescript
// [verify path with team]
interface OrderPreviewProps {
  feeAmountEur: number;
  feeTier: 'standard' | 'small_balance_trade';
}

export const OrderPreview: React.FC<OrderPreviewProps> = ({ feeAmountEur, feeTier }) => (
  <div>
    <FeeLineItem amount={feeAmountEur} showTooltip={feeTier === 'small_balance_trade'} />
  </div>
);
```
```

## Steps
1. Fetch source requirements and identify the ADR trigger.
2. Fetch the ADR template and map required sections.
3. **Confirm repo intel is available.** The repo intel record (language, framework, directory layout) from `architect.github-repo-intel` must be present before drafting any code-related content. If missing, halt and run `architect.github-repo-intel` first.
4. Draft ADR content covering ALL required sections above plus all template sections (context, decision, alternatives, risks, rollout).
5. **Draft API Specification Changes** — enumerate every endpoint touched; state explicitly if none.
6. **Draft Change Flow diagrams** — backend diagram and/or frontend diagram as applicable; each showing only the to-be flow with component labels and API call labels on service-boundary edges.
7. **Draft High-Level Code Changes** — per-repo file-level breakdown using confirmed paths and conventions; include config/env changes. Annotate language and framework per repo.
8. **Draft Metrics and Observability** — metric names, types, labels, alert thresholds, dashboard, log events, runbook pointer.
9. **Draft Code Snippets** — for each non-trivial changed file, write a short illustrative snippet in the confirmed language (from repo intel). Use correct syntax, framework idioms, and file path labels. Mark uncertain paths with `// [verify with team]`.
10. Validate that frontend/backend scopes are both covered when the change spans both.
11. Create/update the ADR in the required parent folder via the documentation MCP. Set the initial ADR status to `Draft`. Use the full drafted content — do not create a placeholder or empty document.
12. **Verify content after publishing**: immediately re-fetch the created document via the documentation MCP and confirm:
    - The document body is not empty.
    - All mandatory sections are present: Context, Decision, API Specification Changes, Change Flow (backend and/or frontend diagrams), High-Level Code Changes, Metrics and Observability, Code Snippets, Alternatives, Risks, Rollout.
    - If the fetched content is empty or truncated, update the document with the full draft and re-verify until confirmed non-empty.
13. Present the ADR URL to the human with this exact message:
    > "ADR is ready for your review: `<adr_url>`
    > Please review the document and either:
    > - Reply **APPROVED** in this session to proceed, or
    > - Set the ADR document status to **Approved** in the documentation system.
    >
    > I will not delegate work to Developer until one of these approvals is received."
14. Wait for approval:
    - **Session approval**: human replies with `APPROVED` (case-insensitive).
    - **Documentation status approval**: re-fetch the ADR document and confirm the status field is set to `Approved`.
15. If the human provides **feedback** instead of approval:
    - Fetch the full current ADR content from the documentation MCP before making any edit.
    - Identify **only** the sections that need to change. Copy all other sections verbatim (see Rule 6).
    - When composing the update payload, embed unchanged sections exactly as fetched — including all Mermaid code fences. Do not re-serialise any diagram block.
    - Revise the ADR via the documentation MCP.
    - Re-verify content after each revision (same check as step 12). Specifically confirm that all `flowchart TD` blocks remain inside their triple-backtick fences.
    - Re-present the updated ADR URL and repeat step 13.
    - Repeat until explicit approval is received.
16. On approval: record the approved ADR URL and return it to the calling workflow. The Developer handoff must include this URL.

## Output
- ADR URL (documentation source)
- Parent folder confirmation
- Requirement-to-decision summary
- Open questions and follow-ups
- Approval confirmation (APPROVED received via session or documentation-system status)
