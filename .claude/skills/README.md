# Skill Catalog

This repository uses a docs-managed skill system to separate role boundaries from reusable capabilities.

## How to use

- Roles in `.claude/prompts/` define authority and constraints.
- Skills in `.claude/skills/` define repeatable workflows.
- Rules in `rules/` define cross-cutting policies (gates, cleanup, conflict resolution).
- Orchestrator assigns required skills for each delegation.

## Cross-cutting rules

Rules in `rules/` are referenced by skills and prompts — not repeated in them:

| Rule file | What it governs |
|---|---|
| `rules/approval-gate.md` | ADR human approval gate definition and state transitions |
| `rules/cleanup.md` | `.tmp/<task-id>/` lifecycle and ownership per agent |
| `rules/design-conflict.md` | How to resolve UX-design vs ADR conflicts |
