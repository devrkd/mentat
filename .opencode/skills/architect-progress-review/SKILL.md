# Skill: architect-progress-review

## Purpose
Assess whether Developer progress for a single sub-task follows the approved ADR scope for the assigned FR and produce a review verdict.

> **MCP availability:** task-board posting is **not** available in this opencode setup. Produce the review comment in chat (and optionally `.tmp/<task-id>/reviews/<fr>.md`) instead of posting it.

## Inputs
- Approved ADR (`adr_url`) — read the FR-specific section
- Sub-task entry from the Architect handoff (fr label, sub-task ID/URL, scope, acceptance criteria)
- Developer change report (files touched, what changed, why, validation results, branch, PR URL)

## Steps
1. Fetch and read the ADR section for the assigned FR.
2. Compare changed files to the sub-task scope — check for out-of-scope edits or missing planned changes.
3. Map each acceptance criterion from the sub-task entry to implementation evidence in the change report.
4. Review validation coverage: confirm the verification commands were run and passed.
5. Classify the outcome: **approved** / **changes requested**.
6. Draft the review comment:
   - Body must include:
     - FR label and sub-task title
     - Verdict: **approved** or **changes requested**
     - Requirement-to-evidence table (one row per acceptance criterion)
     - Scope alignment findings (any out-of-scope or missing edits)
     - Validation results summary
     - If changes requested: list of gaps with severity (critical / major / minor) and an exact description
     - PR URL (from the Developer change report)
7. Deliver the review comment (chat / local file).
8. Return the verdict and the comment location to the Orchestrator.

## Output
- Verdict: approved / changes requested
- Requirement-to-evidence table
- Scope alignment findings
- Validation results summary
- Gap list with severity (if changes requested)
- Review comment location
