# Skill: architect-adr-authoring

## Purpose
Create architecture decision records (ADRs) using the canonical ADR template. This skill is **mandatory for every task** and must be executed before the Developer handoff is produced.

> **MCP availability:** the `documentation` category is **not** bound to an MCP server in this opencode setup. When no doc system is available, write the ADR as local markdown at `.tmp/<task-id>/adr.md` and use that path as `adr_url` in the handoff. All template/section rules below still apply.

## Required Template
- ADR template URL: 
- Template note ID: 

## Rules
1. Always follow the ADR template structure before writing a new ADR.
2. Keep section ordering aligned with the template unless a section is explicitly not applicable.
3. Cover both frontend and backend impacts when the change spans both domains.
4. Create the ADR in the appropriate project location (or `.tmp/<task-id>/adr.md` locally).
5. **Mermaid diagram preservation (partial updates).** When updating only one or more sections of an existing ADR (i.e. not a full rewrite), you MUST:
   a. Read the full current document content **before** composing the update payload.
   b. Copy every section that is NOT being changed **verbatim** — character for character, including all whitespace and newlines.
   c. Never re-serialise, reformat, or re-render any Mermaid block. The triple-backtick fences and the `flowchart TD` line must appear exactly as before. **Do not move `flowchart TD` outside its code fence.** The correct structure is:
      ````
      ```
      flowchart TD
          ...
      ```
      ````
      Any output that places `flowchart TD` on a line that is not directly inside a fenced block is a bug.
   d. If you are unsure whether a section has changed, treat it as unchanged and copy it verbatim.

## Inputs
- Requirement doc ID/URL
- Task ID/URL
- Architect design and implementation plan
- **Repo intel record** (produced by `architect-github-repo-intel`) — required; contains confirmed language, framework, build tool, test framework, directory layout per repo. ADR must not be drafted without this.
- Target parent note ID (or source note parent)
- Related repository links
- Constraints, risks, and acceptance criteria

## Required ADR Sections
Every ADR must contain all of the following sections (in addition to any sections in the template):

### 1. API Specification Changes
For every API endpoint that is added, modified, or removed:
- **Endpoint** — HTTP method + path (e.g. `GET /api/v1/fee-estimate`)
- **Change type** — new / modified / removed
- **Request changes** — new or modified query params, path params, or request body fields (name, type, required/optional, description)
- **Response changes** — new or modified response fields (name, type, description, example value)
- **Breaking change?** — yes/no and migration notes if yes

If no API changes are needed, state it explicitly: "No API changes required."

### 2. Change Flow Diagrams
When changes affect **backend only**: one `flowchart TD` diagram.
When changes affect **frontend only**: one `flowchart TD` diagram.
When changes affect **both backend and frontend**: two separate diagrams — one for backend flow, one for frontend flow — each in its own titled subsection.

Each diagram must show **only the new (to-be) flow** — the proposed changes after implementation. Do not include an AS-IS subgraph.

Each diagram must include:
- Clear component labels (e.g. `User`, `Frontend`, `API Gateway`, service names)
- Decision branches where applicable
- API call labels on edges where a service boundary is crossed

Example skeleton (backend):
```
flowchart TD
    A[Order request] --> B[rfq-platform: validation passes]
    B --> C{user_segment == retail?}
    C -- No --> D[Fee Resolver: fee_tier=standard]
    C -- Yes --> E{order_value < small_balance_threshold?}
    E -- Yes --> F[Fee Resolver: fee_tier=small_balance_trade 2%]
    E -- No --> D
    D --> G[Exchange Engine: order accepted]
    F --> G
```

Example skeleton (frontend):
```
flowchart TD
    A[User enters amount] --> B[GET /api/v1/fee-estimate]
    B --> C[rfq-platform API: returns fee_tier + fee_amount_eur]
    C --> D[OrderPreview: shows EUR fee + info tooltip]
    D --> E[User confirms]
    E --> F[POST /api/v1/orders]
```

### 3. High-Level Code Changes
For each affected repo, list the expected code changes at module/file level. All file paths must use conventions confirmed by the repo intel record (not guessed). Do not write implementation code here — full snippets go in section 5:

Format per repo:
```
Repo: <repo-slug>  [language: <confirmed language>  framework: <confirmed framework>]
  New files:
    - <path/to/file.ext> — <one-line description>
  Modified files:
    - <path/to/file.ext> — <what changes>
  Deleted files:
    - <path/to/file.ext> — <reason>
  Config / env changes:
    - <KEY_NAME> — <description, type, default value>
```

### 4. Metrics and Observability
List every metric the application must expose after this change so the team can track impact and detect regressions:

| Metric name | Type | Labels / dimensions | Description | Alert threshold (if applicable) |
|-------------|------|---------------------|-------------|----------------------------------|
| `orders.submitted` | Counter | `fee_tier`, `user_segment`, `market` | Count of submitted orders by tier | — |
| `orders.fee_collected_eur` | Histogram | `fee_tier` | Fee collected per order in EUR | — |

Also specify:
- **Dashboard** — which existing dashboard should be updated (or a new one created)
- **Log events** — structured log fields to emit
- **Runbook pointer** — link or title of the runbook for alerts related to this change

### 5. Code Snippets
For each file listed in High-Level Code Changes that contains non-trivial logic, include a short illustrative code snippet showing the proposed change. These are **not full implementations** — they show interfaces, key function signatures, and the critical logic block so reviewers can evaluate the approach.

Rules:
- **Use the confirmed language and framework from the repo intel record.** Never guess or use a different language.
- Each snippet must be in a fenced code block with the correct language tag.
- Label each snippet with the file path it belongs to.
- Focus on the changed logic — not boilerplate.
- Mark any uncertain path or name with `// [verify with team]`.

## Steps
1. Fetch source requirements and identify the ADR trigger.
2. Map the required sections above into the ADR template.
3. **Confirm repo intel is available.** Must be present before drafting any code-related content. If missing, halt and run `architect-github-repo-intel` first.
4. Draft ADR content covering ALL required sections above plus all template sections (context, decision, alternatives, risks, rollout).
5. **Draft API Specification Changes** — enumerate every endpoint touched; state explicitly if none.
6. **Draft Change Flow diagrams** — backend and/or frontend as applicable; each showing only the to-be flow.
7. **Draft High-Level Code Changes** — per-repo file-level breakdown using confirmed paths and conventions.
8. **Draft Metrics and Observability** — metric names, types, labels, alert thresholds, dashboard, log events, runbook pointer.
9. **Draft Code Snippets** — for each non-trivial changed file, in the confirmed language. Mark uncertain paths with `// [verify with team]`.
10. Validate that frontend/backend scopes are both covered when the change spans both.
11. Publish the ADR (or write `.tmp/<task-id>/adr.md`). Set the initial status to `Draft`. Use the full drafted content — do not create a placeholder.
12. **Verify content after publishing** (re-read the document or file) and confirm:
    - The body is not empty.
    - All mandatory sections are present.
    - If empty or truncated, rewrite the full draft and re-verify.
13. Present the ADR location to the human with this exact message:
    > "ADR is ready for your review: `<adr_url>`
    > Please review the document and reply **APPROVED** in this session to proceed (or set the status to Approved if the doc system supports it).
    >
    > I will not delegate work to Developer until approval is received."
14. Wait for approval:
    - **Session approval**: human replies with `APPROVED` (case-insensitive).
    - **Status approval**: re-check the ADR status if the doc system supports it.
15. If the human provides **feedback** instead of approval:
    - Read the full current ADR content before making any edit.
    - Identify **only** the sections that need to change. Copy all other sections verbatim (see Rule 6).
    - Revise the ADR, then re-verify content (same check as step 12).
    - Re-present the updated ADR and repeat step 13. Repeat until explicit approval is received.
16. On approval: record the approved ADR location and return it to the calling workflow. The Developer handoff must include this URL.

## Output
- ADR URL (or local path)
- Parent folder confirmation
- Requirement-to-decision summary
- Open questions and follow-ups
- Approval confirmation (APPROVED received)
